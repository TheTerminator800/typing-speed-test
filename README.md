# WPM Typing Speed Test

This is a simple command-line program that will measure the user's typing speed in WPM.

## How it Works

The program will print a passage that is to be typed by the reader. After the user types the passage, the command line will display the user's metrics. The metrics will be saved to a text file. If there are 2 or more entries in the text file, the user will be given the option to view a line plot of his/her metrics over time.
